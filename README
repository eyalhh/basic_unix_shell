The implementation is as follows:
We will have a loop that outputs the string "myshell>" everytime, and waits for inputs.
We will check the input if its a "cd" or "exit" command, if so we will handle them manually.
If it's not a "cd" nor an "exit" command, we will use "fork" syscall to create a child process and then "execve" to change that child process image to the inputted command process image.
We will also have separate files for the built-in commands, (for "exit", because its simplicity, we would just make it in the main file").

In "cd.s" file we will have the function:
int cd(char* directory);
(returns 1 if success -1 if error) - the function itself already handles the errors
which changes the directory from current directory to the inputted directory.

How will we handle the common errors:
